# Timber.io - Powerful Elixir Logging

**Note: Timber is in alpha testing, if interested in joining, please visit http://timber.io**

[Timber](http://timber.io) is a different kind of logging platform; it goes beyond traditional
logging by enriching your logs with application level context, turning them into rich, structured
events without altering the essence of logging. See for yourself at [timber.io](http://timber.io).
